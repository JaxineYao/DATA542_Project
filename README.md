## DATA542_Project

This project examines the DevGPT dataset in order to understand how developers interact with ChatGPT. 

## Description

We used the DevGPT database to investigate the typical structure of conversations between developers and ChatGPT. Using the "issues" and "discussions" files, we performed analyses to determine how many turns it takes to reach conclusions in these conversations, and which types of issues developers most often present to ChatGPT. We also determined the most commonly used programming language in these interactions. 

Within this repository you will find the analysis files, as well as the report summarizing our methodologies and findings. The dataset is too large to upload here, so it must be found using the link below. 

##Data Needed
